# Missing Middle Markup Language (MMML)

MMML is a markup language with TeX-like syntax,
intended to generate HTML documents,
mainly for proposals and technical text.
Many of its features are purpose-built for use in WG21,
such as for writing C++ proposals.

See [GitHub pages for documentation](https://eisenwave.github.io/mmml/).
