\h3{Separators and word breaking}

\h4[id=dir-br]{\dir{br} \c{mdash} Break line}

The \dir{br} directive produces a line break,
and corresponds to the HTML element \ch{<br/>}.
It displays as inline content, and its input content is ignored.

\dir{br} is particularly useful when line breaks are treated same as spaces,
which is the case in most HTML content.

\h4[id=dir-hr]{\dir{hr} \c{mdash} Horizontal rule}

The \dir{hr} directive produces a horizontal rule,
and corresponds to the HTML element \ch{<hr/>}.
It displays as block content, and its input content is ignored.

Here is an example:
\hr

\h4[id=dir-wbr]{\dir{wbr} \c{mdash} Word break opportunity}

The \dir{wbr} directive produces a word break opportunity,
and corresponds to the HTML element \ch{<wbr>}.
It displays as inline content, and its input content is ignored.

\ch{<wbr>} elements can be inserted into the middle of long words,
which, if they don't fit on one line,
will be broken at the point of the \ch{<wbr>} element (without a hyphen at the end of the line).

Since Âµlight only supports UTF-8 output, \dir{wbr} is equivalent to \cm{\\U{200B}},
which outputs a U+200B ZERO-WIDTH SPACE code point.

\tip{
If you want to provide a word break hint but have a hyphen at the end of the line,
use \cm{\\U{AD}} or \cm{\\c{shy}} to output a U+00AD SOFT HYPHEN.
}

\h4[id=dir-word]{\dir{word} \c{mdash} Unbroken words}

The \dir{word} directive is a formatting directive which prevents word breaks within its content.
Its content is an HTML context.
This is done by applying a \tt[css]{white-space: nowrap;} style its content.

\tip{
Another way to prevent word-breaking is to use non-breaking spaces.
You can insert these using \cm{Combined\\c{nbsp}Word}.
