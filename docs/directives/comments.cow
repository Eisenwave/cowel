\h3{Comments}

Unlike many other markup languages,
COWEL has no dedicated syntax for comments.
However, there exists a \cow.dir{comment} directive which you can use to put comments into code.

\h4{\cow.dir{comment} \c{mdash} Comments}

The \cow.dir{comment} directive does not process its arguments or content.
It outputs no plaintext or HTML.

\Bex{
While comments don't output anything,
\ref[#paragraph-splitting] is based on blank lines in the source,
so comments don't split paragraphs:
\codeblock[cowel]{
Text
\\comment{This is \\directive{comment} content.}
Text
}
Generated HTML:
\codeblock[html]{
<p>Text

Text</p>
}
}
