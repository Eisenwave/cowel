\h3{Special characters}

It is quite common that a text document should include special characters.
While COWEL is built on UTF-8,
and in theory one could just write the character directly into the source code,
not every text editor handles special characters well.

To increase portability,
COWEL has the \cow_dir{U} and \cow_dir{c} directives.

\h4[id=dir-U]{\cow_dir{U} \c{mdash} Code point literal}

The input to a \cow_dir{U} directive is a plaintext context,
which should be a sequence of hexadecimal numbers
specifying a \ref[https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#scalar-value]{Unicode scalar value};
that is, a code point which UTF-8 permits to be encoded.

\Bex{
\cow_c{\\U{30}} generates '\tt{\U{30}}' U+0030 DIGIT ZERO.
}

\Bnote{
Like anywhere else, directives inside of \cow_dir{U} are allowed.
}

\h4[id=dir-N]{\cow_dir{N} \c{mdash} Code point by name}

The \cow_dir{N} directive behaves almost identically to \cow_dir{U},
except that its input has to be a
\ref[https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr34/#Names]{Unicode name}
rather than a hex digits.
That is, the name of a code point,
or one of its "control", "alternate", or "correction" aliases.

\Bex{
\cow_c{\\N{DIGIT ZERO}} generates '\tt{\N{DIGIT ZERO}}' U+0030 DIGIT ZERO.
}

\Btip{
\cow_dir{N} can lead to much more descriptive, human-friendly code, compared to \cow_dir{U}.

The main issue with \cow_dir{U} is that it is very non-descriptive in source code.
It simply contains a handful of digits,
and unless the reader is a Unicode expert who happens to know that sequence,
they cannot easily tell what the purpose of the character is.
}

\h4[id=dir-Udigits]{\cow_dir{Udigits} \c{mdash} Digits of code point}

The \cow_dir{Udigits} directive is essentially the inverse of the \cow_dir{U} directive.
Its input is also a plaintext context;
rather than producing a code point from a digit sequence,
it produces a digit sequence from its input code point.

This can be fine-tuned with the following parameters:
\dd{
\dt{\cow_attr{zfill}}
\dd{
The minimum amount of digits that should be produced.
This is an integer argument in range [0, 1024], and defaults to zero.
If the amount of digits is less than \cow_attr{zfill},
it will be left-padded with additional '\tt{0}' characters.
}

\dt{\cow_attr{base}}
\dd{
The base of the output digit sequence, in range [2, 16].
This defaults to 16, meaning that the digits are printed in hexadecimal.
}

\dt{\cow_attr{lower}}
\dd{
A yes/no plaintext argument, defaulting to \tt{no}.
If \tt{yes} is specified, digits beyond '\tt{9}' (i.e. '\tt{A}' to '\tt{F}')
will be output in lower case instead.
}
}

\Bex{
COWEL markup:
\codeblock[cowel]{\literally{
U+\Udigits[4]{x}
}}
This renders as:
\Bindent{
U+\Udigits[4]{x}
}
Note that U+0078 is the usual way in which Unicode code points are represented.
That is, \tt{U+}, followed by at least four hexadecimal digits.
It is also possible to define a macro if we need this frequently:
\codeblock[cowel]{\literally{
\macro[\code-point]{U+\Udigits{\put}}
\code-point{x}
}}
}

\Btip{
\cow_dir{Udigits} can also be combined with \cow_dir{N}
to produce human-readable descriptions of code points,
while also keeping our source code readable:
\codeblock[cowel]{\literally{
\macro[\named-char{...}]{U+\Udigits[4]{\N{\put}} \put}
\named-char{SECTION SIGN}
}}
This renders as:
\Bindent{
U+\Udigits[4]{\N{SECTION SIGN}} SECTION SIGN
}
}

\cow_dir{Udigits} uses only the first code point within the input text,
even though the entire input text is processed into plaintext.

\Bug{
If we provide more than a single code point, some input is discarded:
\codeblock[cowel]{
\\Udigits{abc}
}
This renders as
\Bindent{
\Udigits{a}
}
... which corresponds to \cow_c{a}, whereas \cow_c{b} and \cow_c{c} are discarded.
}

\h4{\cow_dir{c} \c{mdash} Character references}

The input to a \cow_dir{c} directive is a plaintext context,
where the same content is permitted as for HTML character references, aka. HTML entities,
between '\tt{&}' and '\tt{;}'.

\Bex{
Using \cow_dir{U} and \cow_dir{c}, the '\tt{&}' character can be produced in a number of ways:
\ul{
    \li{Literally '\tt{&}' in text}
    \li{\cow_c{\\U{26}} (code point literal for U+0026)}
    \li{\cow_c{\\c{amp}} (like \cow_html{&amp;}, named character reference)}
    \li{\cow_c{\\c{#38}} (like \cow_html{&38;}, decimal character reference)}
    \li{\cow_c{\\c{#x26}} (like \cow_html{&x26;}, hexadecimal character reference)}
}
}

In an HTML context, \cow_c{\\c{xyz}} is literally translated into \cow_html{&xyz;}.
In a plaintext context, the character reference is mapped onto its corresponding code point(s),
and those code points are output directly.

\Bnote{
Like anywhere else, directives inside of \cow_dir{c} are allowed.
}
