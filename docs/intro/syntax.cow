\h2{Syntax in a nutshell}

COWEL has a minimalistic but powerful syntax,
built on top of only three syntactical constructs:
\ul{
\li{\cow.c{\\various-directives[positional args, named-args = 0]{and content}}}
\li{\cow.c{Text.}}
\li{Escape sequences, such as \cow.c{\\\U{7B}}, \cow.c{\\\U{7D}}, \cow.c{\\\\}, etc.}
}

There is no special syntax besides that,
meaning that as long as some bit of code doesn't contain a \cow.c{\\},
it's all interpreted as plaintext.
This makes COWEL exceptionally suited to nest other languages inside of it in code blocks etc.

\h3{Whitespace}

COWEL translates very directly into HTML.
Any whitespace in text is preserved exactly as is.
The way that whitespace is processed then depends on the produced HTML and how it is CSS-styled.

\Bex{
At a top level, whitespace is merged and line breaks are rendered like spaces:
\codeblock[cowel]{
This displays on one line
because line breaks render like spaces.
}
Generated HTML:
\codeblock[html]{
<p>This displays on one line
because line breaks render like spaces.</p>
}
Rendered output:
\Bindent{This displays on one line because line breaks render like spaces.}
}

\h3{Paragraph splitting}

At the top-level in the document and within the content of certain directives,
\dfn{paragraph splitting} takes place.
All content in COWEL is either \dfn{inline content}, \dfn{block content}, or \dfn{meta content}.
Text and escape sequences are inline content,
and directives are sometimes inline and sometimes block content.
Certain directives (e.g. \cow.dir{comment}) that don't generate anything rendered are meta content.

The process of paragraph splitting works as follows:
\ul{
\li{
Blank-line-separated blocks of inline content is wrapped in in \cow.html{<p>...</p>} tags.
Meta content is not counted as a blank line, so it "continues" inline content,
but no effort is made to wrap it in \cow.html{<p>...</p>}.
}
\li{
Block content stays untouched, i.e. it is not wrapped in \cow.html{<p>...</p>}.
However, it also terminates prior inline content, like a blank line.
}
}

\Bex{
COWEL markup:
\codeblock[cowel]{
First paragraph.

Second paragraph.
\\blockquote{This is a block directive.}
}
Generated HTML:
\codeblock[html]{
<p>First paragraph.</p>

<p>Second paragraph.</p>
<blockquote>This is a block directive.</blockquote>
}
}
