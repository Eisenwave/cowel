\h2{Directives}

A \dfn{directive} is a way of generating plaintext, HTML, both, or neither.
You can think of it as a "command" or "function call".

Every directive has three parts:
\ul{
\li{The \cow_c{\\directive-name} selects a specific directive to be processed.}
\li{
An optional \cow_c{[comma-separated, positional arguments, named-arguments = ...]}
provides additional inputs to the directive.
}
\li{
An optional \cow_c{{block of content}} provides a "main input" to a directive.
}
}

\h3{Directive names}

A \dfn{directive name} selects a specific directive to be processed.
The name begins with a \cow_c{\\} character,
followed by
\ref[https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/custom-elements.html#valid-custom-element-name]{
any character that is valid in an HTML (custom) tag name.
}
This includes any alphanumeric ASCII characters,
\cow_cp{002D}, \cow_cp{002E}, \cow_cp{005F},
and various Unicode characters.

\Btip{
You can use an empty block of content to "cut a name short":
\codeblock[cowel]{
Thisisavery\\wbr{}longword.
}
Doing so is equivalent to writing
\cow_c{\\wbr} and \cow_c{longword} immediately following one another.
}

\Bwarn{
The use of '.' (period) characters in directive names is deprecated.
Currently, \cow_dir{a.b} would get parsed as a directive name,
but this behavior will be removed in the future.
This will result in \cow_dir{a} being parsed as a directive name,
followed by plaintext \tt{.b}.
}

\h3{Directive arguments}

\dfn{Directive arguments} can be \dfn{positional arguments} or \dfn{named arguments}.
Arguments are separated by commas.
Unlike anywhere else, whitespace surrounding directive arguments is ignored.

Arguments provide additional information to a directive.

\Bex{
Often, arguments are converted to HTML attributes.
\codeblock[cowel]{
\\b[id = abc]{Bold text.}
}
Generated HTML:
\codeblock[html]{
<b id=abc>Bold text.</b>
}
}

\h4{Named arguments}

Named arguments are of the form
\cow_c{name = value}, where spaces anywhere around \cow_c{name} and \cow_c{value} are ignored.
Named arguments are matched to directive parameters before any positional arguments,
meaning that positional arguments fill the remaining unmatched arguments.

Argument names can consist of any character, except
ASCII control characters,
U+0020\c{nbsp}SPACE,
\cow_cp{0022},
\cow_cp{0027},
\cow_cp{002C},
\cow_cp{002F},
\cow_cp{003D},
\cow_cp{003E},
\cow_cp{005B},
\cow_cp{005C},
\cow_cp{005D},
\cow_cp{007B},
\cow_cp{007D},
and noncharacters.

\Btip{
If you want to provide a positional argument that is \cow_c{name = value} instead,
you can do so by writing:
\codeblock[cowel]{
\\comment{"name = value" as a positional argument}
\\xyz[name \\= value]
\\comment{named argument with name "name" and value "value"}
\\xyz[name = value]
}
Only the literal \cow_c{=} character can be used for named arguments,
not its escaped variant \cow_c{\\=}.
}

\h4{Positional arguments}

Positional arguments are content just like any other content,
except that an unbalanced closing \cow_cp{005D} or a \cow_cp{002C}
ends the content.

\Btip{
You can use escape sequences to continue otherwise ended content.
\codeblock[cowel]{
\\xyz[hello, world]  \\comment{Two positional arguments}
\\xyz[hello\\, world] \\comment{One positional argument containing a comma.}

\\xyz[hello[]world]  \\comment{OK, [] is balanced and included in single argument}
\\xyz[hello\\]world]  \\comment{OK}
\\xyz[hello\\[world]  \\comment{OK}
\\xyz[hello[world]   \\comment{error: unterminated arguments}
}
}

\h3{Directive content}

The \dfn{directive content} is the primary input to a directive.
It is delimited by a '\tt{\{}' and ends with a \em{matching} closing '\tt{\}}'.
This means that you can have opening and closing braces inside text,
but they need to be balanced.

\Bex{
COWEL markup:
\codeblock[cowel]{
\\b{Bold text { with braces }.}
}
Generated HTML:
\codeblock[html]{
<b>Bold text { with braces }.</b>
}
}

Escape sequences don't participate in this "brace matching",
so they can be used to literally produce a brace character.
\Bex{
COWEL markup:
\codeblock[cowel]{
\\b{Bold text \\\U{7B} with brace.}
}
Generated HTML:
\codeblock[html]{
<b>Bold text \U{7B} with brace.</b>
}
}

Unlike in the directive arguments,
whitespace is not trimmed.
\Bex{
COWEL markup:
\codeblock[cowel]{
\\b{bold} \\i{ italic }
}
Generated HTML:
\codeblock[html]{
<b>bold</b> <i> italic </i>
}
}

\Bnote{
Only one such block of content can be provided, unlike in TeX,
which has a similar syntax,
but permits multiple blocks. Each block is separated by a pair of braces.
}

\h3{Directive processing}

Unlike in typical programming languages,
where the input to a function is processed at the call site and the resulting values
are passed into the function,
COWEL directives have \em{absolute} control over their inputs and how they are processed.

Say you have a JavaScript function:
\codeblock[js]{
function f(x) {
    console.log(x);
}
f(2 + 2);
}
\code[js]{f} has no idea that its input was originally \code[js]{2 + 2}.
It only sees the value \code[js]{4} and prints it, "oblivious to the outside".

COWEL follows a different model:
\codeblock[cowel]{
\\comment{\\b{x}}
}
No \cow_html{<b>} tag is ever generated because \cow_c{\\b{x}} is never processed.
\cow_dir{comment} is not magical feature;
it simply has control over all of its contents and arguments,
and it can choose not to process them.

You can even make a \cow_dir{comment2} directive that works
just like \cow_dir{comment} yourself:
\codeblock[cowel]{
\\macro[\\comment2]{}
}

\h2{Contexts and output}

There are two types of contexts: \dfn{plaintext contexts} and \dfn{HTML contexts}.
These control what directives (and other content) will generate.

\Bex{
The COWEL text \cow_c{&} will be converted to \tt{&} literally in a plaintext context,
and to \cow_html{&amp;} in an HTML context.
}


Any directive is capable of generating either plaintext or HTML,
and the output may be substantially different depending on the context.

\Bex{
The \cow_dir{c} directive is used to generate HTML character references, aka "HTML entities".
It converts its input to plaintext to determine the chosen character.
Within such a plaintext context,
directives like \cow_dir{b} will simply output their content as plaintext:
\codeblock[cowel]{
\\c{\\b{Omega}} \\c{Omega}
}
Generated HTML:
\codeblock[html]{
&Omega; &Omega;
}
Also, \cow_dir{c} will only emit an HTML entity in an HTML context.
In a plaintext context (such as in the input to \cow_dir{c}), it outputs the character directly.
For example, if we write:
\codeblock[cowel]{
\\c{\\c{Omega}}
}
The generated (malformed) HTML is:
\codeblock[html]{
&\c{Omega};
}
}
